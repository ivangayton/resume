## Overview

At the intersection of technology, humanitarianism, health, and innovation.

- Over ten years in the hardest and most forgotten/neglected contexts of the world making life better for the most vulnerable.
- Nerd with a keen interest in technology and some moderate coding ability , a good understanding of the realm of the possible in technology and problem domains in the humanitarian field and low-income settings, and pretty good product management skill.
- Manager and leader who likes empowering people to get on with what they're good at while keeping an eye on the goals and big picture.

## Work Experience:

#### Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF or Doctors Without Borders) 2003-2016 (still involved on Board of Directors and advisory roles)

**Head of Mission and other positions**

Managed a number of MSF missions as HoM (Country Director), including Nigeria, Haiti, Libya, and South Sudan. Also worked as Project Coordinator and Logistician in several other countries. Did a stint as Humanitarian Affairs Advisor based in Amsterdam, focusing on migrants. Two years as GIS and Technological Innovation Advisor.  Some highlights:

- Emergency Coordinator during the cholera epidemic following the 2010 earthquake.
  - MSF teams treated over 110,000 patients during the time I was there, with a mortality rate in our facilities of 0.9%. Estimated mortality without treatment was 40%. This was not, of course, down to me; it was an enormous group effort, but I played a genuine part in it, and of all the things I have done in my life it is the one I am most proud of.
- Led teams into Libya during the Arab Spring uprising to support hospitals treating the wounded.
- Led a successful advocacy campaign for an environmental, rather than purely medical, response to the largest lead poisoning crisis in history (Zamfara State, Nigeria).
- Negotiated access for MSF into parts of Pakistan affected by the Baloch insurgency (essentially the only organization to successully gain any kind of access to the affected population).
- Wrote the first project proposal to put a boat on the Mediterranean Sea to rescue migrants - in 2011. Much of that proposal was re-used in 2015, when MSF finally got into sea rescue.
- Identified, promoted, and mentored several people who went on to surpass my own accomplishments within MSF and the humanitarian field.
- Co-founded the Missing Maps project ([missingmaps.org](http://missingmaps.org/)) which has created free, open map data for nearly 20 million people.  
- Led a collaboration with between MSF and Google to create electronic medical records in Ebola centres ([projectbuendia.org](http://www.projectbuendia.org/)). 

#### Wave.com (Mobile Money startup) May 2016-April 2017

**Africa operations**

- Preparing licenses and other prerequisites for Wave&#39;s operations in West Africa, based in Dakar, Senegal.
- Successfully negotiated a bank partnership, Central Bank authorization, Value Added Service provider license, access to USSD and SMS with major telcos.
- Left Wave amicably after a major reorganization left no appropriate role for me compatible with my family&#39;s living circumstances (Wave is no longer focusing on West African expansion).

#### Independent consultant to several humanitarian agencies (various times)

Advisor, project manager, and software product manager

- Advising and to some extent leading an Electronic Medical Records for Emergencies development team ([projectbuendia.org](http://projectbuendia.org/))
- Ongoing support to humanitarian mapping initiative that I co-founded in 2014 ([missingmaps.org](http://missingmaps.org/))
  - Developing a software for off-line mobile image classification for humanitarian mapping ([github.com/mapswipe](http://github.com/mapswipe))
- Development of an offline server for data collection in resource-poor settings ([github.com/ivangayton/ODKAggregateOnEdison](http://github.com/ivangayton/ODKAggregateOnEdison))
- Support to mobile data collection projects in several countries for humanitarian agencies (including complete turnkey setup of OpenDataKit and Kobo Toolbox instances)
- Independent local mapping initiative in the summer of 2017 in Sierra Leone ([Google Doc with info on the project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OCV10fdxtb9OGKK_hKkuFWlHDDy8ULtPsFYqksHUtvc/edit?usp=sharing))

  
#### Robin B Clark Inc. Forestry Consultants, Brinkman & Associates Reforestation Ltd

1995-2003

Project manager from 1996 through 2003. Consulting on an occasional basis between humanitarian missions and other work since 2003.

- Running forestry crews in Canada with up to 75 employees in remote locations.
- Consistently returned high gross margins on projects, while maintaining client satisfaction (therefore company reputation) and high seasonal worker return rate
- Advocated successfully for more ecologically appropriate and cost-effective reforestation standards
- Ecological restoration projects, generally with a focus on biodiversity, often with carbon sequestration implications.
- Teaching practical GIS use for professionals in other fields (who are not specifically in GIS positions but need/want to make high-quality maps for work) using open-source software.

## Selected competencies

- Moderate skill with Python (and Flask), Java (including Android), R, and SQL.
- Strong Shell (bash) scripting. Particularly provisioning for small, low-power embedded systems), and general UNIX (well, GNU/Linux) system administration.
- Networking in resource-poor environments.
- Product Management. Sufficient knowledge of software engineering to effectively lead a team of engineers and designers, and an expert knowledge of problem domains in humanitarian and low-income settings, particularly around health, geography, and data collection.
- GIS software, formerly ESRI products but now almost exclusively free software packages including QGIS, GDAL, PostGIS, etc. Have led development teams building GIS-related applications (MapSwipe). Occasionally teach a practical GIS course for scientists and humanitarian professionals.
- Design and deployment of data collection systems (OpenDataKit and Kobo Toolbox, among others).
- Security management, including in conflict and disaster areas.
- Medical program management in resource-poor settings.
- Advocacy and public speaking. Representation to media, public, and officials in "silent diplomacy" or negotiations.
- Operational ethics, including designing and delivering formal workshops to help humanitarian teams work through dilemmas in the field.
- Academic knowledge in biology, philosophy (particularly ethics), a bit of anthropology, and mathematics. No degree, but three years of university courses with very high grades, but not following a degree program (taking undergrad university classes in the aforementioned fields between humanitarian missions out of personal interest in the subject matter).
